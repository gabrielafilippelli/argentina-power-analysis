## Overview
This project delves into aims to analyze if Argentina is a powerful country and determine its future. Heavy focus was placed on Argentina’s power through three key variables that impact Argentina’s power: political, economic, and social influences. Used STATA to clean and visualize the data, and identified key indicators.

## Programs Used:
STATA

## Data Gathering
With these questions I had, I downloaded datasets from Harvard Dataverse and the World Bank, which are listed under the dataset folder.

## Results
Illustrated through data visualizations and a narrative that Argentina is not a powerful country, and its future is not a powerful one in comparison to other countries in South America.
